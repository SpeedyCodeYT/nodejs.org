## Content vs. Code

The **Website Working Group** is primarily concerned with the code and overall structure of the website.

The content of the website comes from a variety of working groups (Evangelism, Core, i18n, etc). The Website WG defers to these WGs on matters of content and routinely adds collaborators from these working groups as they add and improve content on the website. In other words, the Website WG is not an _editorial_ Working Group except when no other Working Group has taken responsibility for a content area.
